# M3D Fio
OctoPrint plugin for the Micro 3D printer that provides a complete, platform independent alternative to the printer's official software 

Â© 2015 Exploit Kings. All rights reserved.

You can install it with OctoPrint's built in plugin manager. The URL for that is [https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip) or you can install it manually with the command

```shell
pip install https://github.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip
```

M3D Fio works in conjunction with OctoPrint's autodetect serial port and baudrate feature, so neither of those values need to be specified in order to successfully connect to the printer.

If your using Windows and the printer isn't recognized in the device manager, then you'll need to install the drivers manually which are located in `/drivers/Windows/`.

If you are using Linux, the 90-m3d-local.rules needs to applied in order to avoid issues. You can apply it with the following commands:

```shell
wget -O /etc/udev/rules.d/90-m3d-local.rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donovan6000/M3D-Fio/master/drivers/Linux/90-m3d-local.rules
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart
```
